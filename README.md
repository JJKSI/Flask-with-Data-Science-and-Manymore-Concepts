# Flask-with-Data-Science-and-Manymore-Concepts


I am excited to share this project on GitHub, which showcases the integration of data science and machine learning concepts using Flask. Additionally, it includes several smaller projects such as a virtual sunglass application, an image format changer, and a quiz bot.

When working with Flask and downloading templates, there are numerous excellent resources available on the internet. For Flask-related guidance, I recommend referring to the following link: Python3 Flask Tutorial"https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/webprogramming/Python3_Flask.html"
